# .github

This is where org-wide github _stuff_ goes.

If you want to be kept in the loop with changes to our github ecosystem 
and the features available to you, consider adding yourself to the 
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) configuration.

#### This is a public repository.  

Public status is a requirement for github workflow templates. **Do not store sensitive documentation here.**

**Stuff currently in here:**

- [docs pertaining to github or code reviews](docs) (which we do using the github 
  platform).
- [workflow templates](workflow-templates) (required to live in this repository).

Other github features that aren't currently used require artifacts to live in this 
repository, so the name (`UWIT-IAM/.github`) cannot be changed.
